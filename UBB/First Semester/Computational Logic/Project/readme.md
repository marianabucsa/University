This is an optional project for the course


Task:

	Create a console application for processing natural numbers in bases 2,4,8,16.
	The application will have the following features:
		-- conversion of a number to a base by successive divisions
		-- conversion of a number to a base by substitution
		-- conversion of a number to a base through an intermediate base
		-- conversion of a number to a base by fast conversion (2 -> 4,8,16; 4,8,16 -> 2)
		-- sum of two numbers in a given base
		-- subtraction of two numbers in a given base
		-- multiplication of a number by a digit in a given base
		-- division of a number by a digit in a given base

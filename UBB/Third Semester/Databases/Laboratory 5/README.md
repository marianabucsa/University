Task:
	Create CRUD operations encapsulated in stored procedures for at least 3 tables in the database
	(including a many-to-many relationship). You must use:
		-- input / output parameters;
		-- functions (eg for formatting / validating input data);
		-- table / column constraints to ensure data validity.
	Also, create at least 2 views over the selected tables for CRUD operations. For the tables used in 
	the view, create non-clustered indexes.

Tasks:

	-- A file contains an undirected graph represented as: the first line contains the number of nodes and the next lines, the edges of the graph.
	Write a program in C / C ++ that reads the file and represents/stores a graph using the adjacency matrix, the adjacency list,
	and the incident matrix. Convert a graph from one form of representation to another.

	file -> adjacent matrix -> adjacent list -> incident matrix -> adjacent list -> adjacent matrix -> edge list.

	-- A graph is represented in a certain form (the graph is read from a file). Solve:
		-- determine the isolated nodes in a graph.
		-- determine if the graph is regular.
		-- for a graph represented with the adjacent matrix to determine the distance matrix.
		-- for a graph represented by an adjacent matrix to determine if it is connected.

Tasks:

	P1:
	   	Given a weighted oriented graph and a source vertex, calculate the minimum cost from the source vertex to each accessible vertex in the graph.
		Implementation must be efficient in terms of memory used and execution time. (Implement a minimal path algorithm: Bellman-Ford, Dijkstra.)

	P2:
		Given a rare weighted oriented graph, calculate the minimum cost from each vertex to each accessible vretex in the graph. Implementation
		must be efficient in terms of memory used and execution time. (Implement Johnson's algorithm.)

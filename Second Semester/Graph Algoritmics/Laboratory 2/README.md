Tasks:

	-- Implement Moore's algorithm for an unweighted undirected graph. The data is read from the "graf.txt" file. 
	   The first line in graf.txt contains the number of nodes, and the next line contain the edges of the graph.
	   The program must display the shortest chain starting from a node to every other node of the graph(the source node can be read from the keyboard).

	-- Determine the transitive closure of an oriented graph. (The transitive closure can be represented as the matrix that describes, 
	   for each vertex, which are the accessible vertices from it).

	-- Display on the screen, for a given graph, the vertices discovered by the BFS algorithm and the distance from the source vertex (discovered tree).

	-- Display on the screen, for a given graph, the vertices discovered by the recursive call of the procedure DFS_VISIT (G, u) (forest discovered by DFS).

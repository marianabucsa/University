Tasks:
	
	P1:
		Implement a solution, using heuristics, to solve the problem of coloring the nodes of a graph.
		Given an undirected graph, determine the minimum number of colors that are required for coloring 
		and a coloring that meets this minimum number.

	P2:
		The students set a day to get to college by bicycle. They start from the university dormitories 
		and have to reach the central building. Along their route, they can pass by various buildings. 
		There are roads between the dormitories, the city buildings, and the central building. These roads 
		have a one-way street and a certain width that allows a maximum number of students to travel at the 
		same time. Roads are considered to be of equal length, and the students have equal speeds.Once students
		leave for college, they do not want to stop or slow down to their destination. A fixed number of 
		students leave each dormitory at the same time. This number may be different for each dormitory.
		Calculate the maximum number of students who can go to college at the same time and the number of
		students who can leave each dormitory at the same time to get this maximum result.

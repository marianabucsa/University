Task:

	Implement in C ++ a specific data container (TAD) using a certain representation (indicated) and a scatter table (ST) 
	as a data structure, with a certain method (indicated) for resolving collisions:
		-- Independent lists
		-- Intertwined lists
		-- Open addressing

	ADT Multi-Dictionary - memorize pairs (key, value), representation in the form of a ST with open addressing for
	resolving collisions, quadratic verification.
